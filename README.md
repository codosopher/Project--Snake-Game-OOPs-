# Project--Snake-Game-OOPs-
In this Snake Game, we have used various programming concepts to build this game. 
1. we used the concepts of Object Oriented Programming
2. we used data structure Array
3. we used functions 
4. we used some basic algorithms to check if the snake is going out of the bounds or not 
5. we used conditional statements 
6. and, we implemented a game loop
